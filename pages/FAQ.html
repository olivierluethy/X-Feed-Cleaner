        Why does it take so long to filter out distracting content and show only
        posts from people you follow?

        <p>
          By default, X shows you ads, suggestions and even posts that people
          you follow have responded to. In the future, X will add more and more
          content to its products. But the less people or communities you
          follow, the faster the process will be. On average, it will take no
          more than 25 seconds.
